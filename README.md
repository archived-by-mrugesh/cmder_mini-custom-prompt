# cmder_mini_raisedadead
My customization for Cmder | https://github.com/cmderdev/cmder

![](/images/wowee.PNG)

Yup that's the oh_my_zsh like themed, customized cmder for my personal usage.

## Installation
This should just directly work from the scratch without any trouble as long as you have [powerline fonts](https://github.com/powerline/powerline).

```sh
git clone https://github.com/raisedadead/cmder_mini_raisedadead.git
```

Add a shortcut to the `cmder.exe` within the cmder_mini directory on your desktop.

#### NOTE
I have my startup directory fixed at `D:\DEV`.
You might want to change that in `Settings > Startup > Tasks > {hack}`

#### IMPORTANT NOTICE
THIS IS JUST MY CUSTOMIZED VERSION OF [CMDER_MINI](http://cmder.net/) AND NOT MY ORIGINAL WORK AT ALL.
SINCERE THANKS TO THE GUYS AT [CMDERDEV](https://github.com/cmderdev/cmder) AND [AMR ELDIB](https://github.com/AmrEldib) FOR HIS [BLOG POST](http://amreldib.com/blog/CustomizeWindowsCmderPrompt) THAT INSPIRED THIS.
